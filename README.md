# HBNB - Airbnb Clone Project

Welcome to HBNB, the Airbnb clone project! This project aims to replicate some features of the Airbnb website and cover fundamental concepts of higher-level programming through various stages of development. üè†üåü

## Project Overview

The project is structured to be completed over the course of a year. Here are the key components and milestones:

1. **The Console**

   - Implement a command-line interface (CLI) to manipulate data without a visual interface.
   - Develop a storage engine for storing and persisting objects to a file (JSON file).
   - Focus on creating a robust storage system that abstracts the details of object storage and persistence.

2. **Web Static**

   - Learn HTML/CSS to create the static HTML pages of the application.
   - Develop templates for each object in the application.

3. **MySQL Storage**

   - Replace the file storage with a database storage using MySQL.
   - Map object models to database tables using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework.

4. **Web Framework & Templating**

   - Create a web server in Python.
   - Make static HTML files dynamic by incorporating objects stored in a file or database.

5. **RESTful API**

   - Expose objects stored in the application via a JSON web interface.
   - Allow manipulation of objects through a RESTful API.

6. **Web Dynamic**
   - Learn JQuery to load objects from the client-side using the RESTful API.

## Project Structure

**Files and Directories:**

- `models/`: Directory containing all classes used for the project.
- `tests/`: Directory containing unit tests.
- `console.py`: Entry point for the command interpreter.
- `models/base_model.py`: Base class for all models, containing common elements and methods.
- `models/engine/`: Directory containing storage classes.

## Concepts Covered

- **Unittest**: Writing and executing test cases to ensure code quality.
- **Python Packages**: Organizing code into reusable modules.
- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Converting objects to and from JSON format for storage and retrieval.
- `*args`, `**kwargs`: Using variable-length arguments in functions for flexibility.
- **datetime**: Working with dates and times in Python.

This README provides an overview of the HBNB project, we hope you enjoy it.
